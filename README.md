View HTTP history exported from Burp Suite Community Edition(CE).

➡️ **https://adityatelange.github.io/bhhb/**

## What problem does this solve?
- `Burp Suite Community Edition` has one BIG feature paywalled - Disk-based projects 💾.
- Because of which Community Edition users cannot save their `HTTP history` and Sitemap info, which are destroyed after the temporary session is closed 🗑️.
- Although this is a thing, users can export their Burp CE's HTTP history by selecting the records and using "Save items" 💾 option in context menu.
- Using that Burp will export the HTTP history along with Requests and Responses into a XML file.
- **`BHHB`** can open these exported items, parse it and display them in a well-formatted manner. 📋
- This application is a [`PWA`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps), which can be installed in any chromium based browser and could run offline, with all of the processing done on device itself ⚙️.
